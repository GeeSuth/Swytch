# Quickstart

I hope you are ready to get started. In this section we shall get an introduction to Swytch. Be sure 
to follow the [installation](#Installation.md) to set up a project and install Swytch first.



## A Basic Swytch App

A Swytch application in it's most minimal basic form will look something like this 
> Replace the content of Server.cs with the code block

```csharp
using System.Net;
using Swytch.App;
using Swytch.Extensions;


SwytchApp swytchApp = new SwytchApp();

swytchApp.AddAction("GET","/", async (context) =>
{
    await context.WriteHtmlToStream("<h1>Hello from swytch<h1>", HttpStatusCode.OK);
});

await swytchApp.Listen();


```
This is a simple swytch application that starts a server that listens on the default URI prefix `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and sends an HTML response to all HTTP GET requests
to the root path or `/`. For every other path it shall respond with a **404 Not Found** and request to the correct path with any other method apart 
from HTTP GET gets a response of **405 Method Not Allowed**

Now let's go over  what this code does line by line.

1. First we start by specifying all the namespaces which contains usesful classes we need in our application

2. Then we go ahead to create an instance on a swytchApp

3. Next we configure our swytch app on how it should respond when we recieve a request on the home route using the `AddAction` method 
.We  shall refer to this as adding an action to our swytch app. The method takes in 3 arguments .First is
the http methods on which we should perfrom the action, the second is the path and the third is the action method/ handler method
itself. check [guide]() on what makes a valid action method.

4. Then finally we start our server and wait for requests


To run the application simply make sure youre in the project root and then run `Dotnet run`

or just start it from your IDE with whatever button provided.




## SwytchApp

`SwytchApp` represents the running application. An instance of this class is your web app or server.
It holds all configurations, including route definitions, server settings, and static file caching
policies.

You can configure your `SwytchApp` using `SwytchConfig` class, which provides sensible defaults. 
For example, the default configuration for the above application has cache max age is `3600` seconds,
and template precompilation is disabled (`false`). But we can change that with.

```csharp
var app = new SwytchApp(new SwytchConfig
{
    StaticCacheMaxAge = 7200, // Set cache max age to 2 hours
    PrecompileTemplates = true // Enable precompilation
});
```

For more details on available configurations, check the [Guide](#).





## Routing 

Swytch configures routing through the `AddAction` method, where you define the HTTP method(s),
the route path, and the handler method. Note that routes are matched **exactly**, meaning `"/about/"` is
**not the same** as `"/about"`.

The route registration in the above application specifies just one HTTP method,but we can be fancier 
and allow  multiple HTTP methods on the same route by separating them with a comma:

#### Multiple HTTP Methods

```csharp
app.AddAction("GET,POST", "/about", async (context) => {...});
```

You can allow multiple HTTP methods on the same route by separating them with a comma:

This ensures that both `GET` and `POST` requests to `"/about"` are handled by the same action/handler method.

#### Route Matching Order

Routes are **matched in the order they are registered**. If you register the same path separately for different HTTP methods, 
the first one will always take precedence.

For example:

```csharp
app.AddAction("GET", "/about", async (context) => {...}));
app.AddAction("POST", "/about", async (context) => {...}));
```  

In this case, a `POST` request to `"/about"` will still match the first `GET` route,
resulting in a **405 Method Not Allowed** response.

To prevent this, define both methods in a single `AddAction` and make a decision how you handle
a request based on what HTTP method it came with:

```csharp
app.AddAction("GET,POST", "/submit",  async (context) => {

if (context.Request.HttpMethod == "POST")
{
   //handle POST request
   return;
}
//handle GET request
await context.ServeFile("SubmitPage.html",HttpStatusCode.OK);
    
});
```  

By doing this, both `GET` and `POST` requests will correctly match the intended handler.




## Response Extensions

Swytch provides handy extension methods on the `RequestContext` type to quickly send HTTP responses 
like  `WriteHtmlToStream` and `ServeFile` used in our application above to send an HTML response to the client.
You can find these methods in the `Swytch.Extensions` namespace.

For a full list of response methods and utilites currently available, check the [Guide](#).



## Starting the Application

After configuring your Swytch app, you can start it by calling the `Listen` method. By default, it listens on port `8080`:

```csharp
await app.Listen();
```  

You can specify a different URL prefix if needed:

```csharp
await app.Listen("http://localhost:5000/");
```  

**Note:** The URL prefix **must** end with a trailing `/`, or an `ArgumentException` will be thrown.

Also, always `await` this callâ€”if not, the server will start and immediately exit.
