# Note from the Author

Swytch was started by me  [Matthew Gwalisam](https://github.com/Gwali-1) as an educational project to explore C# as a
language and to experiment with a lightweight alternative
for building simple web services or hacking on personal projects without the overhead of ASP.NET/ASP.NET CORE. It has
been a rewarding experience, and I learned a lot along the way.

I work on Swytch in my spare time, balancing it with my professional life and the other million things I have on my
desk. It took over a year to get Swytch to a point where
I felt it was stable enough to share. Since I only work on this when I can afford to, I kindly ask for patience when
raising issues or reporting bugs. I'll address them as soon as I can.
