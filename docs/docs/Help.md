This section covers common questions, issues, and challenges developers may encounter while working with Swytch. Whether
it is setting up authentication, troubleshooting unexpected behavior, or looking for workarounds to specific
limitations.

If you're running into something that isn't documented yet, chances are others might too,so users are strongly
encouraged to [open an issue](https://github.com/Gwali-1/Swytch/issues) or start
a discussion if they encounter a problem or challenge. These reports not
only help improve Swytch but also allow us to document solutions and make them available here to help other users
