### Swytch v1.0.0 â€” First Stable Release

Excited to announce the first stable release of **Swytch**, version `1.0.0`!

Swytch is a fast, lightweight, developer-friendly alternate web framework written in C#. It is designed for building modern APIs, web apps, and static sites with minimal friction.

This release completes the core framework features and serves as a solid foundation for building exciting and robust web applications.

I encourage you to give it a try and hope you will be kind enough to share any feedback you have. I would like to know how practical it is for users other than myself.

Find a detailed guide on the [Swytch Documentation Site](https://gwali-1.github.io/Swytch/) to learn more about the framework and how to use it to its fullest.
